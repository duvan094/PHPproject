# PHP project
This is our project for the course Applied Web Architechture. We are doing our own version of the party game *Would You Rather*. 

## Installation

To run the project it must be run on a server. When creating the database it should be named '*wouldYouRatherDB*' in PHPmyAdmin.
To access PHPmyAdmin us the username 'root' and password '' (Though these should be changed to something more secure).
Then copy everything in the file tables.sql, and then run the SQL code to set up all the tables and insert some sample data.
